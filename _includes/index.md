#A NEW SOLUTION FOR A OLD PROBLEM

Are you tired of having to pay an arm and a leg for baby items that just end up in a pile in the corner of the room as the baby outgrows it?

Cuddle Club is offering is a curated selection of some of the major and most common baby gear items that are used during the first 18 months of a baby’s life. Examples include: strollers, highchairs, rockers, bouncers, activity centers, and play pens. We will offer these items in bundles for a fixed monthly subscription of $59.99.  

#RIGHT ON TIME

Cuddle Club will deliver the items to your home approximately two weeks before the baby’s due date. At various intervals we will send out developmentally and age appropriate gear for the quickly growing infant. For example, we plan on including a bouncer with every subscription, but our research has indicated that a bouncer is typically outgrown at 6 months of age. At 6 months, we will exchange the bouncer for an activity center at that point at no additional cost to you.   You get what you want, and wont have the clutter of keeping all your old stuff.


#HOW WE DO IT
A cornerstone of the sharing economy as a whole is that a product is shared among multiple parties instead of used by individuals making the same purchase. The same is true for Cuddle Club. In order to offer you the latest and greatest in baby gear every year, we will package it into approximately 6 month baby lifecycle bundles to lend to new parents. These bundles will be lent out from one to two times depending on the item before being retired and replaced by new equipment. 

Once the bundles are returned to Cuddle Club they will be sanitized using ozone sanitation technology. ZONO Sanitech, is a company that has developed ozone sanitation lockers that are already used by daycares across the country. These lockers saturate the air around items inside the lockers with ozone gas that is an effective sanitation solution without getting the items wet or leaving an unnecessary residue. This technology is currently being implemented at daycare facilities across the US, and is the best cleaning solution available right now.
